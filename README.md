# Mohak_Portfolio


This is my personal project portfolio website — a collection of selected technical projects that showcase my experience, problem-solving ability, and passion for building real-world solutions.

Each project page includes a brief explanation, key features, and links to the code (and live demos, where available). This portfolio is designed to be shared with recruiters, interviewers, and anyone interested in my work.
